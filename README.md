# HybridVAE
This repository provides an implementation of a Hybrid Variational Autoencoder (VAE) integrated with Multi-Task Learning (MTL) for dimensionality reduction and predictive modeling. The model uniquely combines unsupervised latent representation learning with supervised learning, allowing the latent space to be guided by label information.
